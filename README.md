Showtime is Loritta's content website, this project has everything that requires...

* Server Side Generation, to improve the website SEO.
* Everything that doesn't require Discord auth.
* Little to no JavaScript, using progressive enhancement to have a smooth experience even if the user has bad internet.
* Very quick and snappy performance for the website!

So pages like...

* Loritta's home page
* Command List
* Wiki/Extras
* Fan Arts
* Support
* Blog
* and others...

Are *probably* here in Showtime! And that's why it is Showtime, because the first page that users will look about Loritta are created and hosted by Showtime. ðŸ˜Š
